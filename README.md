# Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo
A repo containing information on Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo data moves.

## Introduction
Part of one of my client engagments is on initiating cross-region data moves within their Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo environment. Along the way, I faced several challenges in finding the objects in my scope and confirming if retention policies have been properly applied. This repository contains some of the PowerShell code I've written to exfiltrate the required data.

My work is standalone, without any affliation to my employer and comes without any warranty on its functions. As always, take caution and care when running someone else's script - understand what the code does and ensure you have back-ups where applicable.

## How to use?
Read the code itself so you're aware of what it will do to your data. Create back-ups, run through your change processes etc.
